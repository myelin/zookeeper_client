zookeeper_client
    by Phillip Pearson
    http://github.com/myelin/zookeeper_client

== DESCRIPTION:

zookeeper_client is a Ruby library to interface with the ZooKeeper
replicated object store / lock server.

Project maturity: early alpha.  Working, although very chatty and
there may be bugs to do with threading.  Expect to get your hands
dirty.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ZooKeeper C client library (http://zookeeper.sourceforge.net/)

  See installation instructions in c/README, in the ZooKeeper source
  distribution.  zookeeper_client expects the headers to live in
  /usr/include/c-client-src/, which doesn't feel right but is where
  they go on my system when I run 'make install'.

== INSTALL:

  $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/
  $ gem install myelin-zookeeper_client

== USAGE:

= Connect to a server

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'myelin-zookeeper_client'
  z = ZooKeeper.new("localhost:2181")

= Create, set and read nodes

  z.create("/bacon", "text to be stored in the new node", 0)
  # => "/bacon"

  data, stat = z.get("/bacon")
  # => ["text to be stored in the new node", #<ZkStat:0xb771be54 @ephemeralOwner=0, @ctime=1216196667669, @aversion=0, @mzxid=1008, @cversion=0, @version=0, @czxid=1008, @mtime=1216196667669>]

  z.set("/bacon", "an entirely different line of text", stat.version)
  # => nil

  z.set("/bacon", "this won't work", stat.version)
  # CZooKeeper::BadVersionError: expected version does not match actual version

  data, stat = z.get("/bacon")
  # => ["an entirely different line of text", #<ZkStat:0xb77125d4 @ephemeralOwner=0, @ctime=1216196667669, @aversion=0, @mzxid=1009, @cversion=0, @version=1, @czxid=1008, @mtime=1216196704709>]

  z.delete("/bacon", stat.version)
  # => nil

= Create ephemeral and sequence nodes

  z.create("/parent", "parent node", 0)
  # => "/parent"

  z.create("/parent/test-", "an ordered node that will disappear when the connection goes down", ZooKeeper::EPHEMERAL | ZooKeeper::SEQUENCE)
  # => "/parent/test-0"

  z.create("/parent/test-", "an ordered node that will disappear when the connection goes down", ZooKeeper::EPHEMERAL | ZooKeeper::SEQUENCE)
  # => "/parent/test-1"

= Acquire locks

  z.try_acquire "/parent/lock-", "content for the lock file" do |have_lock|
    puts have_lock ? "we have the lock" : "we don't have the lock"
  end
  # we have the lock
  # => nil
